						<p>They were just sucked into space. The unexpected is our normal routine. How long can two people talk about nothing? Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Wouldn't that bring about chaos? I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Not if I weaken first. and attack the Romulans. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.</p>

						<h2>Your head is not an artifact!</h2>
						<p>Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Your head is not an artifact! When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? You enjoyed that. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion?</p>

						<h2>Travel time to the nearest starbase?</h2>
						<p>Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this?</p>

					<li><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh btn btn-warning"></i> Build out the responsive page you created for the apprentice badge by adding more pages, improved navigation, and better styling.  You will need to use media queries rather than a framework such as the one found in bootstrap.  </li>
					<li><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh btn btn-warning"></i> Implement your navigation as a stylized list. Use event handling with minimal wiring.  The current page should be indicated in the list.  You should demonstrate that you can create this navigation by hand rather than use a ui component found in many libraries.</li>
					<li><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh btn btn-warning"></i> Improve your responsive design to include scaling/loading images and more interesting content flow.  It is acceptable if some features are not available for smaller sizes. For a great example, see Notre Dame's responsive site at: nd.edu</li>
					<li><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh btn btn-warning"></i> Add a form on one of your pages.  Use CSS to layout the labels and fields.  Use a text box, text area, check box, and a pick list. </li>
					<li><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh btn btn-warning"></i> Style your pages using CSS, stored in a separate file, using the minimum number of IDs and class attributes in your markup.  Use at least 4 kinds of selectors. Provide an example of using multiple backgrounds.  Include a custom font.   Use opacity, drop shadow, and CSS gradient.  Use a transition, transform or an animation.</li>
